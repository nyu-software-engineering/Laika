# Laika: A Crowd Donation Project

## Overview
Crowd Donation Platform with an ERC-20 Web Browser Mineable Token. Anyone can use their web browser to mine a token and donate it to a charitable project of their choice.

## A solution for transparency

Donating money has decreased over the past years due to a lack of transparency of many organizations. Donors are no longer confident in their contributions and they might see it as a waste of money.



Laika Crowd Funding, strives to become a powerful platform where approved 503c organizations can sign up to receive funds using crypto and a blockchain – anyone with a computer can help raise funds with full transparency. Currently, there are some websites which users can mine “Monero” for a good cause. However, the lack of transparency of “Monero” leaves donors wondering where their contributions go.



Our system uses Ethereum Blockchain, guaranteeing confidence in the donation as all transactions are public. Users select from a list of verified donors and they donate their tokens to them, the 503c charity will receive the funds and spend them on a market place within the platform. All purchases are public and the user can track where every coin was spent on. With this straightforward platform we hope to increase the willingness to donate and leave users with a peace of mind.



In the future we hope to merge a mining service where there user will leave a browser tab open to donate therefore, facilitating the process and encourage more people to become generous.
