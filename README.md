# Laika: A Crowd Donation Project

## What
Crowd Donation Platform with an ERC-20 Web Browser Mineable Token. Anyone can use their web browser to mine a token and donate it to a charitable project of their choice.

## Why
Biggest reasons why people do not donate or volunteer are

No Money

No Time

Lack of confidence in what their donations are actually used for
This project will strive to becomes a platform where anyone can create projects to raise fund or donate their computer's processing power to mine tokens to contribute to a project. The token will be built on the Ethereum Blockchain, so everyone can be 100% sure that their contributions all went to the project instead of any middlemen skimming the donation. The ease of just leaving a browser tab on to make a donation will hopefully encourage more people to become generous and make a small or big contribution. In the future, the token usage after donation could be tracked too so the donor will know exactly how the donation was used.
Currently, there are some websites which users can mine Monero for a good cause. However, the lack of transparency of Monero leaves the miners wondering where their donations actually go to.
