## Git Workflow

**Feature Branch Based Workflow**
1. Git pull first
2. Each person create their own working feature Branch
3. Name the branch with the issue type + "/" + the issue number + "/" sub task from the issue (if applicable)
4. Do the changes/work on the issue
5. When completed bug free, push branch back to remote
6. Make a pull request on the trunk branch
7. When making a pull request and merging to branch, make sure that it is reviewed and approved by team members before being merged to the master

A note: A feature should be merged back to the master within 1 - 2 days, so as to ensure the local master branch is as up to date with the remote as possible

* Push often, pull before pushing

## Progress Tracking

* Rotate roles
* In case someone is unable to complete their task (busy, knowledge gap, etc.), voice in advance and seek help asap (team members, tutor, professor)

**Below is our code of conduct, please follow it when interacting with the project.**

## Process for Pull Requests

1. Create an issue describing what you would like to do/add/change. Add the relevant labels, project, and milestone to this issue.

2. To begin work, create a branch with a descriptive name of your issue (either number of issue, or description of issue).

3. All changes you wish to make should be built into the branch that you made. When adding files, ensure you only add new files/files you changed so as to avoid accidentally deleting other changes. Pull before you push and push frequently!

4. When finished making changes, create a pull request to the master branch, named after your issue. Explain changes you are making, for example "Updating REQUIREMENTS.md."

5. This will be reviewed by both developers and the scrum master, who will decide whether or not to accept the request, and close the issue.

6. Merging a branch will require review and approval from at least one other team member.
