### Current Tools
- Actblue: good analytics, displays which fundraising event and social media platform has the best return
It also records the email of the donors so she can easily put them to an email list.
Downside: Donors cannot specify why they are donating
- Crowdrise for walkathon 
- Eventbrite: regular fundraiser
-  :silent auction online
- Paypal / Venmo

### Brooklyn Animal Actions
- 6000 email list
- Transaction fee matters the most, then user friendliness
- Interested in anything that make charity more accessible to others, whatever that raise them more money


### Concerns
- Problem with transparency: when people don't know the orgganization well, they might misunderstand what you spend on. e.g. pamphlets
- Online platforms tends to only leave bad reviews. 5 bad experience out of 800 ends up on Yelp
- People can be invasive and destructive
- Donation with specific use will tie them up
- Amazon smile has been effective, where a portion of the puchase goes to donation.
- High transparency is not a good fit for small non-profit because they don't want to receive that kind of scruitiny
- Don't want to have a different pot of money
